## Sales-Web-MVC

The web system is designed to manage information on sales made by registered vendors, including their personal information. The system features a department section that allows users to create, edit, and delete departments, as well as a vendor section where new vendors can be added, and existing ones can be edited or deleted. The system also records sales made by vendors, and allows for simple or grouped filtering of sales by department. This system was built using C# ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server database.
